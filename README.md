## Project Title:
Computational Geometry - Polygon Triangulation of Implicit Defined Objects

### Description
Collection of algorithms for converting signed distance functions into explicit polygon meshes. This project is meant as a playground for comparision and tested with different algorithms, optimizations and combinations of signed distance functions. It contains a 3D mesh viewer and can export to .ply and .obj

Developed as part of a research project at the IT University of Copenhagen.

### Features
Triangulation algorithms:
- Marching Cube (Weighted and Unweighted)
- Marching Tetraheda (Weighted and Unweighted)
- Naive Surface Nets (Weighted and Unweighted)

Signed distance functions:
- Cube
- Box
- Sphere
- Cylinder
- Cone
- Torus
- Plane
- Goursat's Surface
- Sine Waves
- Supports parametric equations

Mesh viewer:
- Inspect multiple polygon meshes at once
- Export to .obj or .ply
- Step-by-step algoritm visualization

Additional:
- Contains implementation of Polychop
- Contains implementation of Perlin Noise
